This content is for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. 
By nature, these notes are necessarily incomplete and without context to the individual patient's condition, and were created in the course of studying ayurveda from modern perspective. They omit a lot of details, as Ayurveda is by itself a large body of knowledge and only tids and bits which may be useful and answer common queries are provided
These have been compiled from many diverse sources, though full care has been taken that they are from standard texts.
They are provided in the belief that people may find them useful in the sense that though all this information exists already and is known to the experts in the field, it is not easily available, especially in an electronic searchable format.
Always seek the advice of your doctor with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition. 
If you think you may have a medical emergency, call your doctor or emergency medical services immediately.
